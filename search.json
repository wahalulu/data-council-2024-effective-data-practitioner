It includes skills such as problem formulation, decomposition, organization, and logical analysis of data, and is recognized as a key 21st-century skill.\nStatistical thinking involves the logical and statistical analysis of data, using visualizations and statistical methods to identify patterns and anomalies. It emphasizes the importance of preserving the meaning derived from the domain knowledge when performing any process or calculation on data.\nDomain thinking refers to the understanding and application of domain-specific knowledge in the context of data science. It involves the integration of computational and statistical thinking with the knowledge and context of a particular domain, such as social science or medicine, to improve computational models and domain understanding.\nTogether, these modes of thinking are essential components of data thinking, which is the integrated skill set needed to work effectively with data science. Data thinking treats algorithms and data equally, combining computational thinking, statistical thinking, mathematical conceptions, and context-based thinking associated with the application domain.\n(Hazzan and Mike 2023; Adhikari and Jordan 2021)"
