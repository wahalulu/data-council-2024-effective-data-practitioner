Competencies, on the other hand, are broader and include a combination of skills, knowledge, and attributes that enable someone to perform effectively in a job or situation 1 .\nCompetencies are often described as more holistic, encompassing not just the ability to perform a task (skill) but also the understanding (knowledge) and the appropriate application (attributes) of that skill in various contexts. They reflect a person’s capability to apply or use a set of related knowledge, skills, and abilities required to successfully perform “critical work functions” or tasks in a defined work setting 1 .\nIn summary, while skills are specific to certain tasks, competencies are more comprehensive and relate to the overall ability to perform a job effectively, which includes a combination of multiple skills, the knowledge of when and how to use them, and the attitude or behavior to perform them successfully 1 .\n(Weiser et al. 2022)"
