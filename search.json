The competences involve the development and implementation of strategies and systems for managing data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring its quality, accessibility, and compliance with standards 1 .\nHere is a summary of the competences identified in the DSDM section:\n\nDevelop and implement data strategy, particularly in the form of data management policy and data management plan (DMP).\nDevelop and implement relevant data models, define metadata using common standards and practices, for different data sources in a variety of scientific and industry domains 1 .\nIntegrate heterogeneous data from multiple sources and provide them for further analysis and use 1 .\nMaintain historical information on data handling, including reference to published data and corresponding data sources (data provenance) 1 .\nEnsure data quality, accessibility, interoperability, compliance to standards, and publication (data curation) 1 ."
