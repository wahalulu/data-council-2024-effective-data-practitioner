	abstract = {Data science has been growing in prominence across both academia and industry, but there is still little formal consensus about how to teach it. Many people who currently teach data science are practitioners such as computational researchers in academia or data scientists in industry. To understand how these practitioner-instructors pass their knowledge onto novices and how that contrasts with teaching more traditional forms of programming, we interviewed 20 data scientists who teach in settings ranging from small-group workshops to large online courses. We found that: 1) they must empathize with a diverse array of student backgrounds and expectations, 2) they teach technical workflows that integrate authentic practices surrounding code, data, and communication, 3) they face challenges involving authenticity versus abstraction in software setup, finding and curating pedagogically-relevant datasets, and acclimating students to live with uncertainty in data analysis. These findings can point the way toward better tools for data science education and help bring data literacy to more people around the world.},

However, other prior work has also shown that avoiding the detailed subcategorization leads to challenging problems, for example, the pursuit of the elusive ‘data science unicorns.’ In this article, we target a simplification of prior work and an anchor categorization of job roles with clear definitions and expectations from each. We achieve this through analysis of survey results, LinkedIn profiles and job descriptions, and in-depth interviews with managing and hiring executives in data science. We also use our judgment as long-term practitioners and employers of data scientists to provide a practice-guided view of the problem.},

While such certifications and classifications are in their early days, some firms are beginning to create them, and they are beginning to emerge in professional associations as well. Ideally, universities and other education providers and certifiers of data science skills would also employ standard skill classifications to communicate the skills they intend to inculcate.},
