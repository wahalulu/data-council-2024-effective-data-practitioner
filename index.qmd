- Back-End Programming (ex: JAVA/Rails/Objective C)
- Bayesian/Monte-Carlo Statistics (ex: MCMC, BUGS)
- Big and Distributed Data (ex: Hadoop, Map/Reduce)
- Business (ex: management, business development, budgeting)
- Classical Statistics (ex: general linear model, ANOVA)
- Data Manipulation (ex: regexes, R, SAS, web scraping)
- Front-End Programming (ex: JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
- Graphical Models (ex: social networks, Bayes networks)
- Machine Learning (ex: decision trees, neural nets, SVM, clustering)
- Math (ex: linear algebra, real analysis, calculus)
- Optimization (ex: linear, integer, convex, global)
- Product Development (ex: design, project management)
- Science (ex: experimental design, technical writing/publishing)
- Simulation (ex: discrete, agent-based, continuous)
- Spatial Statistics (ex: geographic covariates, GIS)
- Structured Data (ex: SQL, JSON, XML)
- Surveys and Marketing (ex: multinomial modeling)
- Systems Administration (ex: *nix, DBA, cloud tech.)
- Temporal Statistics (ex: forecasting, time-series analysis)
- Unstructured Data (ex: noSQL, text mining)
- Visualization (ex: statistical graphics, mapping, web-based dataviz)

## In 2024, the hard truth: an _overloaded_ definition and set of expectations leading to the _Data Practitioner Soup_

`DALL·E 3 prompt:` An ethnically and gender diverse group of at least eight sorcerers standing around a large cauldron labeled "Data Science" acting as if they are throwing stuff in. The cauldron must be visible. The liquid in the cauldron is bubbling and smoke is rising. The smoke cloud is translucid and there it's just plain

## The complexities of defining data science

(expand on this)


- _science_
- _research paradigm_
- _research method_
- _discipline_
- _workflow_
- _profession_ 

## Mastering the broadness is extremely difficult and needs time

## And teaching is even harder!

Teaching stories

## Build a tool to help process all this information
Build a RAG

## Academic models of skills and competencies for Data Science

- iadss

## We need to be careful, though
