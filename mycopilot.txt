"can you add a more detail to each of the thinking models and provide list skills associated with each of them"


Yes, there is a mapping of tasks to skills within the context of data science competencies. The documents indicate that competences are linked to specific knowledge topics and skills, which are then used to define the structure of a curriculum or training program  ^1^  ^2^  ^3^ . For example, the EDSF ontology can be used to extract all required knowledge topics, map them to knowledge areas (KAs) and knowledge units (KUs), and define a relevance score, which in turn helps in constructing a curriculum by mapping these to model curriculum learning units  ^1^  ^4^ .   
  
Additionally, the documents mention that there is no direct mapping between individual competences and knowledge topics; a single competence may be mapped to multiple knowledge topics and vice versa  ^3^  ^5^ . The CF-DS provides a mapping between knowledge topics defined for individual competences and knowledge units defined in DS-BoK  ^3^ .   
  
Furthermore, the documents describe Group B Skills, which refer to data analytics and data handling languages, tools, platforms, and applications, including SQL- and NoSQL-based applications and data management tools, and how these skills are described in relation to data science competencies  ^5^ .   
  
In summary, the documents provide evidence of a structured approach to mapping tasks to the necessary skills and knowledge areas in the field of data science, which is used for curriculum development and professional training  ^2^  ^3^  ^4^  ^5^ .

"summarize the data literacy graphic"

The graphic presents an overview of data literacy, which is crucial for UX designers. It defines data literacy as the ability to consume knowledge, produce coherently, and think critically about data. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the context, technical issues, data collection and processing methods, source limitations, sample size, and methodology when working with data. It also touches on the importance of being aware of biases such as selection, confirmation, survivorship, hindsight, curse of knowledge, and clustering illusion. The graphic underlines the significance of collaborating with developers and data scientists, conducting one's own research, and integrating both qualitative and quantitative methods.  
   
Moreover, it details aspects of quantitative research, including numeracy, statistical literacy, baseline, statistical significance, and common errors like random noise and sampling bias. It highlights the need for data quality, data cleaning, understanding the relationships between variables, and different data types (quantitative and discrete). The process of data analysis is broken down into deciding what to measure, collecting data systematically, and analyzing and interpreting the data to add meaning and inform decisions.
